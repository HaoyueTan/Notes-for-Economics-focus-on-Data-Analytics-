## Notes for Economics(focus on Data Analytics)

Notes based on some of my undergraduate Econ major courses since the summer between Yr2 and Yr 3 ;) As shown in the title that my major has a focus on ata analytics, thus notes are majorly focused on econometric models. Since English is not my mother tongue, sry for any typos in advance.

- Forecasting and Time Series Econometrics(half-finished, fixing)
- [Applied Economatrics I](https://github.com/HaoyueTan/Notes_for_Economics/blob/main/Applied%20Economatrics%20I%20%26%20II/ECO375%20Lecture%20Notes.pdf) 
- Applied Econometrics II(fixing)

Best,
